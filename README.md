# Code Challenge in Python

<p>The following repository was created as a response to the final evaluation challenge for the completion of my Python track course.
The <a href="https://github.com/dangquangdon/Python-0-to-1-Day-to-Day/blob/master/FinalExam/questions.md">original request</a> presented six coding challenges of increasing difficulty.</p>

<p>The challenges were:
<ul>
<li>to write a function that checks if a given word is a <b>palindrome</b>;</li>
<li>to implement a method that would receive two arrays and return an array containing the <b>unique names</b>/elements from the previous arrays;</li>
  <li>to implement the <b>IceCreamMachine's scoops</b> method that returns all combinations of one ingredient and one topping or none if ingredients or topping is missing;</li>
  <li>to write a <b>pipeline method</b> accepting several functions and looping through them;</li>
<li>to write a function accepting several <b>dictionaries</b> containing owners and filenames and <b>grouping</b> them based on the unique owner key;</li>
<li>to implement a <b>function is_repeating_playlist</b> that returns true if a playlist is repeating or false if it is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details on the specifics for each challenge can be found inside every separate script as introduction to it.</p>

<p>p.s.: <b>Please note</b> the files will not appear in the order of described challenges due to being inserted ascending by name from a-z.</p>
